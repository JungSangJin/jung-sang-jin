>**How to use**
First, you need to make a rough design to make an app.
You have to think about how to organize the menu and how to operate it.
If you finish the design, go into the block and design the program. Once you have finished setting up the block, You can download and run the app
(#synchronization) section).


**Process**
We have 3 difficulty levels to choose from for the pronunciation correction. The beginner level is practiced with the words and the intermediate level is practiced with the sentence.
The advanced level can be practiced freely by entering the sentence.
I have made it possible to practice pronunciation by putting text, words and sentences in each step and pronunciation training.
And I have made it possible to practice more effectively by using voice recognition function and recording function.
In the beginner stage, if you select a word and press play button, So you can practice what you say. You can also record what you say and play it and hear how it was pronounced.
Intermediate level is the same. Here we start with sentence unit.
Listen to the same pronunciation, practice, record what we said and play it well.
In the advanced level, it is possible to practice without limit by typing the sentences freely in the text.
