**Process**
 - We have 3 difficulty levels to choose from for the pronunciation correction. The beginner level is practiced with the words and the intermediate level is practiced with the sentence.
 - The advanced level can be practiced freely by entering the sentence.
 - I have made it possible to practice pronunciation by putting text, words and sentences in each step and pronunciation training.
   And I have made it possible to practice more effectively by using voice recognition function and recording function.
 - In the beginner stage, if you select a word and press play button, So you can practice what you say. You can also record what you say      and play it and hear how it was pronounced.
 - Intermediate level is the same. Here we start with sentence unit.
 - Listen to the same pronunciation, practice, record what we said and play it well.
 - In the advanced level, it is possible to practice without limit by typing the sentences freely in the text.
